## About the AI
It's a very basic implementation of the [Monte Carlo tree search algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search) for the game so the AI is not very strong.
However it can search very fast (up to 20000 iterations per second) so a better playout strategy and proper exploration parameter tuning will make this AI a lot better.
